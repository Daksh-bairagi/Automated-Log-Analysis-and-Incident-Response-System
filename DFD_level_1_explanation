Level 1 DFD - Theory
Purpose:
The Level 1 DFD breaks down the central process into major sub-processes, showing internal data flows and data stores.
Key Components in  Diagram:
1. Processes (Numbered 1.0 - 10.0):

1.0 Collect Logs - Gathers raw logs from application and system servers
2.0 Preprocess Logs - Cleanses and normalizes raw log data
3.0 Analyze Logs - Examines processed logs for patterns and issues
4.0 Detect Anomalies - Identifies suspicious activities using detection rules
5.0 Classify Incidents - Categorizes detected anomalies by severity
6.0 Generate Alerts - Creates notifications for classified incidents
7.0 View Reports - Provides interface for analysts to access analysis results
8.0 Configure Rules - Allows administrators to update detection parameters
9.0 Manage Users - Handles user access and permissions
10.0 Monitor System Status - Tracks system health and performance metrics
11.0 Execute Auto Response - Performs automated remediation actions for critical alerts

2. Data Stores:

D1: Raw Logs DB - Stores unprocessed log data
D2: Processed Logs DB - Contains normalized and cleaned logs
D3: Incidents DB - Repository of classified security incidents
D4: Detection Rules - Database of anomaly detection patterns
D5: User Access DB - User authentication and authorization data
D6: System Status Metrics - Performance and health indicators

3. Data Flow Examples:

Raw logs → Store → Preprocess → Analyze → Detect Anomalies → Classify → Generate Alerts
Configuration updates flow from administrator to rules database
Analysis results flow back to security analysts
ML insights feed into the detection process
