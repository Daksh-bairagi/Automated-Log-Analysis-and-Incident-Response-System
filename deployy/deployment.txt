1. Host Site (Target Server / Cloud)

We are planning to host the application components as follows:

Log Collection Agents

Installed on monitored servers (client machines) where logs are generated.

These agents will send logs to the central system.

Log Processing & Analysis Engine

Hosted on a cloud server (e.g., AWS EC2 / Google Cloud VM).

Responsible for receiving, parsing, and analyzing logs.

Incident Response Module

Hosted on the same cloud server as the analysis engine.

Executes automated response actions such as alerts or scripts.

Database

Hosted on a managed cloud database service (e.g., AWS RDS / Cloud SQL).

Stores logs metadata, detected incidents, and response history.

Dashboard / User Interface

Hosted on a cloud web server.

Provides visualization of logs, alerts, and incidents to users.

2. Deployment Strategy (Planned Steps)

The planned deployment strategy is as follows:

All backend components will be deployed on a central cloud server to simplify management.

Each major component (log analysis, incident response, database, dashboard) will be logically separated as independent services.

APIs will be used for communication:

Log agents → Log analysis engine

Log analysis engine → Incident response module

Backend services → Dashboard

Configuration files will define:

Log sources

Alert thresholds

Response rules

The system will be designed to support scalability, so components can later be containerized or moved to separate servers if required.

3. Security Measures (Optional)

The following security mechanisms are planned:

Authentication & Authorization

Only authorized users can access the dashboard.

Role-based access for administrators and normal users.

Secure Communication

APIs will use encrypted communication (HTTPS).

Secure credentials for database access.

Network Security

Firewalls will restrict access to internal services.

Only required ports will be exposed.

Log Integrity

Logs will be protected from unauthorized modification.

Access to raw logs will be limited to administrators.
